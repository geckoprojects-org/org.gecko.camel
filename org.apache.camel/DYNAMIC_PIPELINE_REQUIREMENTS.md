# Dynamic Pipeline Requirements

## Vision

Create a configuration-driven, dynamic Camel pipeline system where consumers are created based on configuration and only become active when all their specific dependencies are available. This enables a truly modular and scalable architecture.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Configuration-Driven Consumer Creation

Each consumer is created from configuration that defines:

- **Pipeline Reference**: Reference to a named, reusable pipeline definition
- **Inline Pipeline**: Complete pipeline definition embedded in the consumer configuration
- **Consumer-Specific Parameters**: Runtime parameters, endpoints, scheduling, etc.

### 2. Dynamic Dependency Analysis

For each pipeline configuration, the system must:

- **Parse Pipeline Definition**: Extract all required Camel artifacts from the pipeline
- **Identify Required Processors**: Extract processor names referenced in routes
- **Identify Required Components**: Extract Camel components (timer, direct, log, etc.)
- **Identify Required Languages**: Extract language expressions (simple, header, constant, etc.)
- **Identify Additional Dependencies**: Type converters, data formats, custom components

### 3. Per-Pipeline Readiness Tracking

Each pipeline gets individual dependency tracking:

- **Pipeline-Specific Condition**: Track readiness state for each unique pipeline
- **Granular Dependency Monitoring**: Only wait for services actually needed by this pipeline
- **Independent Lifecycle**: Different pipelines become ready at different times
- **Dependency Change Handling**: React to services appearing/disappearing dynamically

### 4. Pipeline Reusability

Enable efficient resource utilization:

- **Template-Based Pipelines**: Reusable pipeline definitions that can serve multiple consumers
- **Parameterization**: Support for runtime parameters in pipeline templates
- **Shared Context Strategy**: Decide whether to share CamelContext between consumers using same pipeline
- **Configuration Isolation**: Keep consumer-specific configuration separate from pipeline logic

### 5. Dynamic Consumer Lifecycle

Support runtime flexibility:

- **Hot-Deployment**: Add new consumers at runtime when dependencies are satisfied
- **Graceful Degradation**: Disable consumers when dependencies become unavailable
- **Automatic Recovery**: Re-enable consumers when missing dependencies return
- **Configuration Updates**: Handle configuration changes without system restart

## Architecture Components

### Configuration Manager
- Parse consumer configurations
- Validate pipeline definitions
- Extract dependency requirements
- Manage configuration updates

### Dependency Tracker
- Monitor OSGi service registry for required services
- Track per-pipeline readiness state
- Publish pipeline-specific condition services
- Handle service lifecycle events

### Pipeline Registry
- Store and manage reusable pipeline definitions
- Provide pipeline template resolution
- Handle pipeline versioning and updates
- Validate pipeline definitions

### Consumer Manager
- Create/destroy consumers based on readiness
- Manage consumer-to-pipeline associations
- Handle consumer configuration updates
- Coordinate with CamelContext lifecycle

### Context Factory
- Create CamelContext instances when pipelines are ready
- Wire dependencies into contexts
- Handle context sharing strategies
- Manage context lifecycle

## Advanced Considerations

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Pipeline Status**: Real-time view of which pipelines are ready/waiting
- **Dependency Tracking**: Visibility into what each pipeline is waiting for
- **Metrics Collection**: Track consumer performance and resource usage
- **Event Logging**: Audit trail of configuration changes and lifecycle events

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Partial Failures**: Handle scenarios where some dependencies fail after pipeline is running
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry when dependencies become temporarily unavailable
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures in complex pipeline chains
- **Health Checks**: Monitor pipeline health and dependency status

### Integration Considerations
- **OSGi Integration**: Leverage OSGi service registry and Configuration Admin
- **EMF Integration**: Specific support for EMF processors and data types
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization for configuration management
- **Clustering**: Support for distributed pipeline management (future consideration)

### Performance & Scalability
- **Lazy Loading**: Only create contexts and routes when actually needed
- **Resource Pooling**: Efficient reuse of contexts and connections
- **Parallel Processing**: Handle multiple pipeline readiness checks concurrently
- **Memory Management**: Clean up unused pipelines and contexts

### Configuration Formats
- **Multiple Formats**: Support JSON, YAML, Java DSL for pipeline definitions
- **Schema Validation**: Validate configuration syntax and semantics
- **Migration Support**: Handle configuration format upgrades
- **External Configuration**: Support for configuration from external sources (ConfigAdmin, etc.)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Basic configuration parsing and dependency extraction
2. Simple per-pipeline condition services
3. Consumer creation based on readiness

### Phase 2: Advanced Features  
1. Pipeline reusability and templating
2. Hot-deployment and configuration updates
3. Enhanced error handling and resilience

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
1. Performance optimization and resource management
2. Comprehensive monitoring and observability
3. Advanced configuration formats and validation

## Complex Parts to Solve

The following aspects represent the most challenging implementation areas:

1. **Dependency Extraction from Pipeline Definitions**
   - Parsing route configurations to identify all referenced services
   - Handling different configuration formats (Java DSL, XML, YAML)
   - Static analysis of dynamic route building patterns
   - Detecting indirect dependencies through component chains

2. **Context Sharing Strategy**
   - Determining when consumers with identical pipelines should share CamelContext instances
   - Managing context lifecycle when shared between multiple consumers
   - Handling context-specific configuration vs. shared configuration
   - Resource cleanup when last consumer using a shared context stops

3. **Configuration Update Handling**
   - Managing changes to pipeline definitions while consumers are actively using them
   - Coordinating updates across multiple consumers using the same pipeline
   - Graceful migration from old to new pipeline versions
   - Rollback strategies when updates fail

## Success Criteria

- **Dynamic Behavior**: Consumers automatically start/stop based on service availability
- **Resource Efficiency**: Only create contexts and routes when actually needed
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Support multiple configuration styles and sources
- **Zero Downtime**: Handle configuration changes without service interruption
- **Observability**: Clear visibility into system state and dependency relationships
